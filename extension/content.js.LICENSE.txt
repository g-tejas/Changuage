    * getElementsByTextContents
    * @description                                     Extremely-lightweight, flexible method which allows the user to search the DOM for all nodes containing a specific, 
    *                                                  provided search string. Supports DOM tree scoping, case-(in)sensitivity as well as an exclusionary selector to omit 
    *                                                  nodes matching said selector. No dependencies.
    * @param   {string/regex}  searchText              A string or a regular expression that will result in a match for the text the user wishes to find within the page
    * @param   {boolean}       caseSensitive           Whether or not the search should be case sensitive [default: false]
    * @param   {string}        exclusionarySelector    A valid CSS selector that will exclude any nodes that match it (use "" or null to disable) [default: 'script']
    * @param   {node}          scope                   A valid DOM node within which to begin the search (the "topmost" DOM object in the tree) [default: document.body]
    * @return  {array}                                 Returns either an array of nodes (the parentNodes of any node containing the search text) or an empty collection
